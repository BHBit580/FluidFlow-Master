Water Mechanics Logic ----

Our logic of water is plain simple but in a very tricky way and contains many shading effects. 
The logic is -- Our water consists of several small ball shaped blue color particles which individually have rigidbodies on them.
 
Our main camera will not render the water instead water will be render by another camera called as CameraFluid.
There is a Quad called as Fluid VisualQuad this quad will be rendered by CameraFluid.
The fluid visual quad has a material called as FluidVisual. This material has a shader called as FluidShader.
This shader will make the water particles balls in a very dissolve way and will create a sense like water is flowing.
Then the shader is applied on the FluidVisual material and the material is applied on the FluidVisualQuad.
Hence the FluidVisualQuad is continuously rendering the water and then this quad will be seen by CameraFluid camera .
Hence after that our water will look like actual water.


Pipe Rotation Logic ----
There are some pipes which can be rotated by about 90 degree when player touches then the logic is simple when player 
touches the pipe then the pipe will rotate by 90 degree . I have used coroutine instead of update function for this purpose. 
When player touches the pipe then the coroutine will be started and the pipe will rotate by 90 degree.

UI LOGIC -----

There are UI buttons like Up button and down button these buttons will be used to move our main camera up and down. 

When player click on start simulation button then this button will raise an event called as start simulation event.
This event will be listened and executed by water spawner script. 
When water spawner script will receive this event then it will start spawning water particles.

There is also a countdown timer when our start simulation event is fired when the timer is zero then another event will be fired called as level finished event.
Then this level finished event will be listened by GameOverUI script and then our GameOverUI parent will turn on all it's children and
 then the gameover UI will be displayed

This gameOver UI will also get the noofwater particles hit by the bucket and after that it will display of water is filled or game is over 
There are 2 buttons reply and next level buttons.
When player clicks on reply button then the current level will be replayed and when player clicks on next level button then the next level will be loaded.
